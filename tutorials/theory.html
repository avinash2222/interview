Null - It represents a non-existent or a invalid value.

Symbol - It is a new data type introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. It is used to store an anonymous and unique value.
var symbol1 = Symbol('symbol');
Primitive data types can store only a single value. To store multiple and complex values, non-primitive data types are used.

var obj1 = {
  x:  43,
  y:  "Hello world!",
  z: function(){
     return this.x;
  }
}
     
// Collection of data as an ordered list
     
var array1 = [5, "Hello", true, 4.1];   

Explain Hoisting in javascript.
Hoisting is a default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top.
